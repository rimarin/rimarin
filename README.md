### Hi there 👋

Master student in Computer Science at the [Technical University of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/), majoring in database systems.

#### Projects

- **Towards an Optimal Physical Layout for Efficient Query Processing** (ongoing): implemented one-dimensional and multi-dimensional structures (kd-tree, QuadTree, Hilbert Curve). Applied data partitioning in Parquet based on such structures. Benchmarked range queries across different dataset, workloads and partition size.

- **Query Rewrite Optimization for NebulaStream**: contributed to the query optimizer of [NebulaStream](https://github.com/nebulastream), an open source stream processing system for IoT, written in C++. Implemented query re-write rules from a proposed catalogue with tests validating the correctness. Performed experiments and evaluated the performance impact of new re-write rules.

- **Implementation of a Database Engine**: worked on a project involving the development of several components of a single node relational database system. Implemented modules from the storage level to the query parser. Developed Table Page Layout, Adaptive Replacement Cache, Buffer Pool Manager, some Operators and Optimizers.

- **Hook-In Privacy Capabilities for gRPC**: Java library for enhancing privacy in gRPC, implementing Purpose Based Access Control and providing an extendable set of data minimization primitives.
