### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Master student in Computer Science at the [Technical University of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/), majoring in database systems.

#### Ongoing projects:

- **Towards an Optimal Physical Layout for Efficient Query Processing**: implemented several multi-dimensional data structures (FixedGrid, kd-tree, QuadTree, STRTree, Hilbert Curve). Applied data partitioning based on these structures, using C++ Arrow APIs and Parquet. Benchmarked range queries across different datasets, workloads and partition size.
